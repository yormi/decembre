# team-leader ← product-owner

Spec-change notifications from the product-owner persona. Each entry names one subproject whose `spec.md` changed (REQs added, edited, or deleted) and signals to the team-leader that test / code / prune work is now pending there.

The team-leader reads this file at session start. When it processes an entry — by running the relevant wave(s) for that subproject — it cuts the entry from this file and appends it to `from-product-owner-done.md` with a one-line outcome.

## Format

Append at the top (most recent first):

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <subproject-path-relative-to-repo>

**Change type:** added | edited | deleted (one or more)
**REQs affected:** REQ-NNN, REQ-NNN, ...
**Summary:** 1–2 sentences on what changed in the spec.
**Suggested waves:** test-writer · coder · pruner (any/all — leader decides final scope)
```

`<subproject-path>` is the directory holding the changed `spec.md`, e.g. `nutrition/tomato/plant-needs` or `requirements.md` for the root cross-app file.

A single turn that touches multiple subprojects writes one entry per subproject.
